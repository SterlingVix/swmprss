Why is she so happy? Why does she have a cauldron related sexual hangup? What does a witch do when her career path is not abundantly clear? These are questions you might be able to answer if you were to take this story and make some broad generalizations about it. There is no need to do that. Just sleep. The moral of the story is "The Life of a Pirate is Very Hard Indeed". How the moral is connected to the story is unclear, but the protagonist does say it towards the end. Just listen and fall asleep without learning anything.<br /><br />This Trending Tale is based on what was hot on Twitter on 10/19 at 5:33 PM PDT</p><p><a href="http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/151/" target="_blank">Original Episode is Here</a></p><p><span><a href="http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/shirts/" target="_blank">Shirts are on SALE NOW until July 6th</a></span></p><p>#sleepersummer Call in and leave a voicemail at (318) 475-3379 or (318)4sleepy  about who or what has given you encouragement or support or anything else on your mind!!! #sleepersummer</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/group/invite/166541-sleeper-summer?invite_key=186827aa4aa193407098f4960ebcad4a8afd3cab&utm_medium=email&utm_source=copypastegroup" target="_blank">GOODREADS group for Sleeper Summer Reading projects</a></p><p>Subscribe: <a class="powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_itunes" title="Subscribe on iTunes" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sleepwithmepodcast-podcast/id740675898?mt=2&ls=1" rel="nofollow">iTunes</a><a href="http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/android" target="_blank"><span>Android</span></a><a href="http://sleepwithmepodcast.libsyn.com/rss" target="_blank">RSS</a></p><p><a href="http://www.saveitfortheshow.com/" target="_blank">Thanks to Dan from "Save It For The Show"</a></p><p>Support the podcast by shopping on<a href="http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/amazon" target="_blank"><span> </span>Amazon</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1410705719253513/" target="_blank"><span>Facebook Community</span></a> A place to share and be shared with other listeners!!!!</p><p>Sign up for our <a href="http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><span>NEWSLETTER</span></a></p><p>Twitter hashtag to submit random show ideas <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thesilvertone&src=typd" target="_blank">#thesilvertone</a> or the older <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23silvertone" target="_blank">#silvertone</a></p><p><a title="Itunes Link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sleepwithmepodcasts-podcast/id740675898" target="_blank"><span>Subscribe in iTunes</span></a></p><p><a title="sleep with me on facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/Sleepwithmepodcast" target="_blank"><span>Become a fan on Facebook</span></a></p><p>On Twitter <span><a title="dearest scooter on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/dearestscooter" target="_blank">@dearestscooter</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/1294947960/playlist/7Gn3Kuak285ObPFZd1m7Ua" target="_blank">Spotify Playlist</a></span></p><p>Sleep With Me is a bedtime story designed to take your mind off of the racing thoughts that keep you awake at night.</p><p>As you listen you will find yourself distracted from your worries and drifting off into dreamland..due to the fact the story gets a little bit more boring with each passing minute</p><p>This podcast is a little weird, a bit silly and a tad offensive so beware.
